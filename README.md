# Automatic-License-Plate-Detection-
This project is designed to detect and recognize license plates from images using advanced computer vision techniques and machine learning models. The system is capable of identifying the license plate region in the input image, extracting the text, and processing it for various applications such as automated toll collection, parking management, and traffic monitoring.
Image Processing: Supports license plate detection from still images of various resolutions and formats.
Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Extracts and recognizes text from the detected license plates.
High Accuracy: Utilizes deep learning models to ensure high accuracy in plate detection and recognition.
